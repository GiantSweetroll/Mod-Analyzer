     <notes>Ordinator overhauls the perk trees of Skyrim, replacing them with ~400 new perks to improve the depth and fun of building and playing your character. It accomplishes this in a lightweight, compatible and clean fashion.</notes>
     <general_compatibility>- Ordinator is compatible with mods that overhaul combat mechanics.
- Ordinator is compatible with mods that add weapons and armor. 
- Ordinator is compatible with mods that add new NPCs.
- Ordinator comes with a Thief Skills Rebalance plugin that changes many game settings related to thief skills. This will overlap with most thief overhauls and many combat overhauls, and the mod that is loaded lowest takes precedence.
- Mods that modify the vanilla smithing perks (Elven Smithing, etc), their associated crafting recipes and/or crafting requirements will take effect regardless of load order. For instance, a mod that prevents you from crafting Dwarven items until you complete a quest will do so even if loaded above Ordinator. Consult the description of your smithing mods to learn more about their features.
- All mods that modify the same skills or perk trees will conflict with each other. If the other mod only modifies a few perks that are not essential to its functioning, load it above Ordinator so Ordinator has precedence.
- The perks to upgrade crafting furniture (Advanced Lab, Advanced Workshop, Arcane Nexus) may not work correctly with non-standard crafting furniture in some player home mods. Crafting furniture that lacks the necessary keywords cannot be upgraded, and crafting furniture with a custom model may result in floating objects (open the console, select the objects and type disable to fix this).
- A small number of spell packs may need a compatibility patch in order to support Destruction dual casting perks. See above under "Known compatibility list".</general_compatibility>

               <reason>While Ordinator's features such as Thief's Eye are compatible out of the box, Bruma modifies a single perk, causing a conflict that is fixed by this patch.</reason>
